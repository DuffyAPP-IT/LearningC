# Bancrypt
This is my first CTF challenge I have developed in C.

The aim of the challenge is to understand the logic applied to each pin during the encode and decode operations, by reverse engineering the binary.

Using this knowledge, the user should find the secret pin, held in some form within the binary, and using the logic of the encode and decode operations, crack the secret pin and return the flag.
